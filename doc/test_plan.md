# Project Test Plan
***
## Introduction

This document sets forth a testing plan for testing aspects of Oracle's Glassfish V3 Java application server. Our team will test installation, configuration, deployment, administration GUI functionaly, and monitoring component peformance. 

## Scope

## Document's Purpose

Our team has created this test plan as a roadmap for evaluating Glassfish V3 according to its documenation. 

## Test Criteria

### Installation and deployment

* Testing silent install using generated configuration file
* Deploying Applications and modules
* Modifying the configuration of web applications or modules
* web module deployment guidelines
* ejb module deploymnet guidelines
* deploying a connector module
* assembling and deploying an application client module

### Checking Admin GUI
  
* Test default settings
* Configuring domains
* Change JVM
* Configure Logging
* Configure monitoring service
* asaadmin
  
### Peform adequate testing for diverse configurations

* by product of Installation and admin gui testing ?
  
### Performance Validation 

* [monitoring?](http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-4495/ablur?a=view)

## Evaluation Criteria

Test results will be compared expected expected results pulled from the Glassfish V3 documentation. A Test passes if the test results matches the expected results. Tests can be grouped into logical groups. A Test group will pass if all tests pass.
